Automatically increments and displays version number stored inside  vimrc file itself. Version number is automatically updated when a modified vimrc file is saved.

Displays version number  of vimrc in use when vim is started. This makes it easy to ensure that you have your latest copy of vimrc on different computers.

Also useful if someone you know uses your vimrc wholesale, or if there are a few versions of "standard" versions of vimrc going around in your environment.
